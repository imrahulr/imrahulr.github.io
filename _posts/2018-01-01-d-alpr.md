description:  An automatic number plate recognition system for Indian car license plates using traditional image processing techniques and convolutional neural networks.
---

- Developed an automatic number plate recognition system for Indian car license plates using two different approaches. 
- The first approach was based on image processing to detect the position of number plate and then using Tesseract OCR to extract the registration number present on the plate. 
- The later approach was based on a Convolutional Neural Network with sliding window which outputted the probabilities of 10 digits/characters as well as an extra output to indicate whether the plate is present in the image or not.
